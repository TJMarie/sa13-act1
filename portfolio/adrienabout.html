		<div class="about">
		<h5><i>Who Am I?</i></h5>
		<p>adrien is a queer, Black and Korean indie artist based in Memphis, Tennessee. 
		They specialize in abstract visual art and the composition and performance of alternative music.
		Being classically trained in piano and violin, they have branched out to guitar and bass guitar in order to shift towards alternative rock.
		"I, Paranoia", their first release, was conceived, written, performed, sung, and produced by one person.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<h5><i>Inspiration</i></h5>
		<p>Genetic depression and anxiety have been a lifelong struggle for the artist, having endured obsessive suicidal thoughts and hospitalizations for attempts on their own life.
		After being involuntarily committed, they were forced to grapple with the permanence of death, the reality of life, and the responsibility of having loved ones.<p/>
		<p>As a result, they made a resolution to continue with the rat-race and use their life to improve others'.
		Though Depression will likely always be a struggle, the goal is to make it an afterthought, seeking education and accomplishments to place at the forefront.
		In this corrupt, American justice system, the plan is to use a career in law to represent minority populations whose voices are too often disregarded.</p>
		<hr/>
		<h5><i>Art</i></h5>
		<p>In the meantime, let us create art for the sake of art. 
		One of adrien's strongest beliefs is that the creative pursuit is one of the greatest coping mechanisms available.<p/>
		<p>
		In one form or another, art is accessible to anyone, regardless of physical or mental ability.
		Much unlike traditional therapy (which undoubtedly has its place), conceptualizing and producing art is nearly free,
		which is why our society should be emphasizing and allocating resources towards artistic programs in schools.
		Instead, art programs across the country are being gutted while police forces and the military budget grow increasingly overpowered.<p/>
		<hr/>
		<p>Being true to the authentic self, retaining critical thinking, and questioning everything is paramount to improve oneself, and are hallmarks of a great artist.
		I strive never to forget that.

		</blockquote>
		<!--
		<p>I am a Black/Korean visual artist. For years I have suffered from chronic anxiety and depression, which I 
		hope lends a dark light to my art that would not be possible otherwise.</p>
		<p class="me">Like comedians who write jokes to cope with their personal <em>demons</em>, I create art to cope with the heaviness of everyday life and the difficulty I have functioning in regular society.</p>
		
		<hr/>

		<h5><i>Who Cares?</i></h5>
		<p>Why should you care? You could ask that about anything and everything. Perhaps you should care because I am human, and you are human, and so we inevitably will share some sort of common experience.</p>
		<p class="me">Maybe my art will stir something in you. Maybe not. Maybe you must make the conscious decision to let me in. And maybe it will never matter either way. <em>Maybe nothing matters.</em> I think that is a 
		likely possibility.</p>
		<p>Maybe all I can do is make you think, but I would be satisfied with that, as long as you think about everything.</p>
		<hr/>

		<h5><i>Where Am I Going With This?</i></h5>
		<p>I have never been afraid of death, but I am deathly afraid of senility. Invisible disease ravages the mind and leaves one as a shell of their former being. Though our lives are longer than human history has ever seen, it still feels like we have so little time to enjoy them.</p>
		<p class="me">While I am here and while I am lucid, I want to dismantle the machinations of our broken minds. <br /> I want to learn and create and destroy and cry and understand and be understood and love and 
		<em>be loved</em> and express myself. I believe this is the only way to live.</p>
		<p class="me">We should be okay with feeling sad. It should never be shunned or looked at as a "negative emotion."It should be celebrated. How wonderful it is that every one of us can relate to any specific feeling.<br /> Melancholy; Schaudenfreud; Grief; Love. Why do we not try harder to relate to each other through our suffering? Each of us share <em>99.99 percent </em>of the same genetic stuff. Why do we not find that more significant?</p>
		<p>Instead, we judge, shun, hate, kill each other. Neither you nor I are innocent. We are all human. We are all prejudiced.<br /> To be alive is to be imperfect. The only true escape is death. Cult leaders don't have some sort of reward waiting for you after you drink their Flavor Aid or eat their applesauce and lie on white sheets because death <i>is</i> the reward.</p>

            <p>Taking care of myself has always been difficult.
                Mental health has been a huge factor in that. 
                Turns out I'm bipolar, which I always suspected.
            </p>
            <p>Now that I'm medicated, I feel like I have a new lease on life.
                It's still a struggle to remember to take my meds every day,
                and I still eat way too much ice cream. It takes baby steps.

            <h3>Ender</h3>
            <p>I was driving home one night when a dog stopped in front of my car.
                I slammed on the brakes. Pulling over that night turned out to be
                one of the decisions of my life.
            </p>
            <p>This dog ended up biting most of the people in my life,
                not hard enough to upset most of my friends, but enough 
                to upset me.
